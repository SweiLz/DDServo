DDServo
===
The DDServo project provides custom electronics and firmware for servo motors based on Robotis INC. RX-28 and RX-64 models. Details about the development and design can be found in the [project documentation](http://www.sim.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/publ/da/2011-wojtusch.pdf "Thesis"). The custom servo motors were used in the autonomous, soccer playing humanoid robots of the [Darmstadt Dribblers](http://www.dribblers.de/ "Darmstadt Dribblers").
